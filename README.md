In the moonlit night, so wild and free, Wolves roam the forest, a sight to see. With eyes that gleam like stars above, They move with grace, a symbol of love.
Their howls echo through the silent air, A call of the wild, beyond compare. In packs they thrive, a family strong, Together they hunt, where they belong.
Their fur so sleek, in shades of gray, They wander through night and into day. With hearts so fierce, yet spirits kind, In wolves, true beauty you will find.
Majestic creatures of the night, In their presence, pure delight. Wolves, oh wolves, so wild and grand, The guardians of the forest land.
